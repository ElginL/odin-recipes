        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 (12 Pound) bone-in ham</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings in heavy syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) jar chopped maraschino cherries</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>

                Place ham in a roasting pan. Score the rind of the ham with a diamond pattern. Press a clove into the center of each diamond. 
                Drain the juice from the pineapple rings into a medium bowl, and stir in the brown sugar and lemon-lime soda. 
                Coat the ham with this mixture. Arrange the pineapple rings over the outside of the ham. 
                Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring, and secure with a toothpick.

            <li>
                Bake uncovered for 4 to 5 hours, basting frequently with the juices, until the internal temperature of the ham is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). 
                Be sure the meat thermometer is not touching the bone. Remove toothpicks before serving.
